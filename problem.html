    <hr>
            <p id="c">One-third of all food produced globally by weight is lost or wasted between farm and <br> fork — that's <a class="z" href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/unep-food-waste-index-report-2021"> more than 1 billion tonnes.</a> Converted into calories, this equates to 24% <br> of the world’s food supply going uneaten. At the same time, <a class="z" href="https://www.fao.org/interactive/state-of-food-security-nutrition/2021/en/">1 in 10 people</a> <br> globally remain malnourished. <br><br>

                This scale of food loss and waste harms not only human health and nutrition but also <br> economies and the environment. Wasted food takes a major financial toll, costing the <br>global economy more than $1 trillion every year. It also fuels climate change, <br>accounting for approximately 8%-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. <br><br>
                
                And if current trends persist, food loss and waste will double by 2050. <br><br>
                
                Here, we delve into the scope of this challenge and the global benefits of reducing <br> food loss and waste, as well as solutions at the individual, local and national levels. <br><br></p>

  </section>
  <img class="j" src="problem2.png" alt="">
  <section class="e"><div class="f"><b>What Causes Food Loss and Waste?</b></div><br><br>
    <p id="g">While food loss and food waste are often talked about together, these terms <br>encompass different issues throughout the food system. <b>Food loss </b>refers to loss at or <br>near the farm and in the supply chain, for example, during harvesting, storage or <br>transport. <b>Food waste</b> occurs at the retail level, in hospitality and in households. <br><br>

        Food loss and waste are caused by a wide range of issues, from technological <br> challenges to consumer behaviors. Some common drivers of food loss include: <br><br>
       <ul id="h"> 
      <li> <b> Inadequate technology:</b> Poor infrastructure, such as roads that flood or are hard to travel <br> consistently, can prevent food from making it from farm to table. Lack of cold storage is another <br>major concern for ensuring food can arrive fresh to markets. Farmers may also struggle with <br>inadequate equipment such as old or inefficient machinery that makes it difficult to harvest all <br>of a crop. <br></li>
      <li> <b> Suboptimal packaging:</b> How foods are packaged can make a big difference in the length of <br>time they stay safe to eat. Many people are justly concerned about the environmental impacts of <br> excessive packaging, but it’s important to remember that correct packaging can help foods stay <br>fresher for longer, thereby reducing spoilage and the associated <a class="z" href="https://www.wri.org/insights/methane-gas-emissions-climate-change">methane emissions</a> that result <br> from wasted food. An underappreciated fact is <br>that the environmental impact of wasted food is greater than that of packaging waste. So, while it’s important to limit this waste, it’s also <br>important to use correct packaging to reduce food spoilage. <br><br></li></ul>

        Some common reasons for food waste include: <br><br>
        
        <ul id="i"><li><b>Poor food management:</b> Examples include insufficient skills and knowledge among staff who <br>prepare food, which can lead to unnecessary waste during cooking, and inflexible procurement <br>requirements such as retailers only stocking perfect-looking produce or not accepting a <br>farmer’s oversupply of crop. Food waste can also occur when retailers and food providers do <br>not adequately forecast and plan for demand to meet supply (or vice versa).</li><br>
       <li><b> Consumer behaviors:</b> Households account for the majority of food wasted at the consumer and <br>retail level. This often results from a lack of awareness of the scale of the issue and insufficient <br>education about how to properly use up and store food at home. Food waste also stems <br>from <a class="z" href="https://www.wri.org/insights/shifting-social-norms-food-waste">norms and attitudes</a> that say wasting food is normal, as well as concerns about possible <br>risks of eating food past its sell-by or use-by date label.</p></li></ul>

  <p id="k">There used to be a view that food waste, which happens at the consumer level, tended <br>to be more of a developed country problem while food loss, which can arise from <br>issues in farming and supply chains, was a greater problem in developing countries. <br>But recent research has shown this isn’t true. <br><br>

    Work by the <a class="z" href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/unep-food-waste-index-report-2021">UN Environment Programme </a>shows that food waste occurs at roughly <br>the same level in middle-income countries as in high-income countries. Good-quality <br>data is still limited, but there is a reasonable amount of information to back up this <br>conclusion. Similarly, recent work by the <a class="z" href="https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/driven_to_waste_summary.pdf">World Wide Fund For Nature <br>(WWF)</a> concluded that food loss on farms is a problem in high-income countries as <br>well as middle- and lower-income countries. These recent studies show that both <br> issues must be addressed on a global scale.</p><br><br>

<section class="e">   <div class="f"> The Global Benefits of Reducing Food Loss and Waste</div><br><br>
<p class="a"><a class="z" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12">The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals</a> include a call to halve food waste and <br>reduce food losses by 2030 for good reason. Reducing food loss and waste generates <br>benefits for economies, for businesses and consumers, for human health and for the <br>environment.</p><br><br>

<div class="b"><b>Improved global nutrition and food security</b></div><br><br>
<p class="a">Reducing food loss and waste can play a big role in providing a healthy, nutritious <br>diet to a growing global population. Not only does one third of all food produced by <br>volume go uneaten, but perishable foods with higher nutritional value, such as fruit <br>and vegetables, are particularly prone to loss and waste: More than 40% of produce by <br>weight is lost or wasted worldwide each year. Ensuring more of the global food <br>supply is used to feed people, rather than perishing or ending up in landfills, is an <br>important strategy for addressing hunger in a world where hundreds of millions still <br>face malnutrition.</p><br><br>

<div class="b"><b>Reduced greenhouse gas emissions</b></div><br><br>
<p class="a"><a class="z" href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions">Project Drawdown</a> has listed reducing food loss and waste as the single-best strategy <br>for reducing emissions and fighting the climate crisis. Because up to 10% of global <br>emissions result from food loss and waste, it’s simply not possible to achieve the Paris <br>Agreement’s goal to stay within 1.5-2 degrees C (2.7-3.6 degrees F) of warming <br>without tackling this issue.<br><br>

Emissions from food loss and waste result from the energy and inputs used to <br>produce food that’s ultimately not consumed, as well as the methane that’s emitted <br>when food rots in fields or landfills. Although shorter lived than carbon dioxide, <br>methane is an especially potent greenhouse gas with over <a class="z" href="https://www.wri.org/insights/short-lived-climate-pollutant-reductions">80 times the warming <br> power</a> of CO2. By reducing food loss and waste, we avoid its associated planet- <br>warming emissions. <br><br>

Improving existing food systems  will also help the world feed more people without <br><br>expanding cultivated areas. Agricultural expansion is a major driver of <a class="z" href="https://www.wri.org/insights/5-questions-about-agricultural-emissions-answered">greenhouse gas <br>emissions</a> and often results in deforestation, which releases stored carbon dioxide and <br>lowers the land’s carbon storage capacity. In addition, increasing the efficiency of food <br>production could potentially liberate agricultural land for reforestation, an important <br>way to <a class="z" href="https://www.wri.org/insights/6-ways-remove-carbon-pollution-sky">remove carbon </a>from the atmosphere. </p>

   <p class="a"> WRI has identified alleviating land use pressures — through efforts like reducing the <br> need to produce more food to compensate for loss and waste — as a key strategy <br>to address <a class="z" href="https://www.wri.org/insights/manage-global-land-squeeze-produce-protect-reduce-restore"> the global land squeeze.</a> <br><br></p>

    <div class="b">Financial savings for businesses and consumers and increased financial security for farmers</div>
  <p class="a">  Reducing consumer food waste by even 20%-25% by 2030 could save the world an <br>estimated $120-$300 billion per year. These savings play out on an individual level as <br>well as a systemic one; by consuming more of what they purchase, households can <br>reduce their overall spending on food. Eliminating avoidable food waste would save <br>the average family in the United Kingdom more than £700 ($870) each year, while in <br>the United States, the average family would save approximately $1,800. <br><br>
    
    Reducing food losses — especially post-harvest losses, including food that’s grown <br>but never makes it to market — will also improve farmers’ incomes. <br><br>
    
    Without the resources to buy up-to-date equipment, many farmers must rely on <br>manual approaches or old, broken equipment that limits their potential yields. <br>Targeted loans and financing can help these farmers buy better equipment, allowing <br>them to harvest more and better-quality crops in a shorter amount of time. The <br>efficiency savings may then lead to higher income. In addition, many smallholder <br>farmers are women who would especially benefit from access to finance and new <br>equipment; reduced food losses could mean they are better positioned to feed, educate <br> and care for their families.</p><br><br>
    
   <div class="f"> <b>How to Reduce Food Loss and Waste at a Systemic Level</b></div><br><br>
   <p class="a"> Because food loss and waste happen at every stage of the supply chain, everyone has a <br>vital role to play in addressing this issue.</p><br><br>
    
    <b class="b">Households</b><br><br>
   <p class="a"> Households can reduce food waste by focusing on smart shopping and food storage. <br>Some strategies include writing a shopping list, planning meals so that when you go <br>shopping you know what and how much you need, understanding the difference <br>between use-by and best-by date labels, making sure your fridge is set to the optimal <br>temperature, understanding how best to store different foods and making the most of <br>your freezer for leftovers.</p><br><br>
    
   <b class="b"> Restaurants</b><br><br>
   <p class="a"> Restaurants can reduce food waste by monitoring and managing food usage and <br>ordering. Strategies include measuring food waste in the kitchen to understand what <br>foods are being wasted and designing a fix, engaging staff to understand the <br>importance of minimizing waste, avoiding super-sized portions, and focusing on a <br>smaller range of menu offerings in order to better forecast supply ordering. <br><br>
    
    In September 2022, Ingka Group, IKEA’s largest retailer, became the <a class="z" href="https://champions123.org/release-first-global-company-halves-food-waste-showing-un-target-achievable">world’s first <br>major company</a> to cut food waste in half, having done so across all its IKEA <br>restaurants in 32 markets. Such savings can also bring financial benefits for <br>restaurants, with the average restaurant examined in a Champions 12.3 <br>study saving <a class="z" href="https://champions123.org/publication/business-case-reducing-food-loss-and-waste-restaurants">$7 for every $1 invested</a> in programs to combat food waste.</p><br><br>
    
   <b class="b"> Retailers</b><br><br>
   <p class="a"> Retailers can reduce food waste by improving stocking and food handling practices. <br>Strategies include measuring the amounts and types of food being wasted to identify <br>hotspots that can be reduced; training staff in temperature management, product <br>handling and stock rotation; accepting less-than-perfect looking produce; and <br>educating customers about better food management — for example, how to meal plan <br>and understand date labels, and tips for safe food handling at home.<br><br>
    
    Many retailers in the UK now include storage advice on food packs (such as “Store in <br>the fridge”) and give customers menu cards with ideas for cooking the produce or <br>foods they purchase. Some are also removing “Best before” date labels from fruit and <br>vegetables, which can help consumers avoid throwing away food that is still perfectly <br>edible. Retailers are explicitly telling customers that these measures are intended to <br>reduce waste and encouraging people to use their senses to tell if food is still good to <br>eat.</p><br><br>
    
    <b class="b">Food producers</b><br><br>
    <p class="a">Farmers, ranchers and fishers can reduce food losses by improving farming practices; <br>for example, by ensuring produce is harvested at the right maturity and using <br>appropriate harvesting equipment to maximize yield while minimizing crop damage. <br>They can also improve their skills or use tools to better schedule harvesting, including <br>accessing better data on weather via new apps like <a class="z" href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1641501">Mausam</a> (which is published by <br>India's Ministry of Earth Sciences). And they can engage customers such as <br>wholesale retailers to communicate implications of order changes.</p><br><br>
    
    <b class="b">Food distributers</b><br><br>
   <p class="a"> Packing, storage and distribution facilities can reduce food loss and waste by re-<br>examining handling, storage and transportation to ensure adoption of best practices <br>and reduce damage. They can also use technological interventions to optimize the <br>transport of food, and work upstream with customers to provide planning tools and <br>handling and storage technologies that help them reduce losses.<br><br>
    
    For example, bar coding is being used to track food’s transportation journey, so <br>managers can know where a product has been, for how long, and in what <br>temperatures and conditions. This allows retailers to more accurately label and handle <br>food to maximize shelf life, while also providing traceability in the event of a recall.</p><br><br>
    
   <b class="b"> Processors and manufacturers</b><br><br>
   <p class="a"> Processors and manufacturers can reduce food loss and waste by implementing <br>technical solutions in the supply chain. Strategies include improving training to <br>reduce technical malfunctions and errors during processing, reengineering production <br>processes and product design to reduce waste, using product sizes and packaging that <br>reduce waste by consumers and standardizing date labels to reduce confusion.</p><br><br>
    
    <b class="b">Governments and policymakers</b><br><br>
    <p class="a">Governments and policymakers can reduce food loss and waste through educational <br>programs, policies and financial incentives that support more efficient food <br>production and distribution. For example, they can embed food loss awareness,<br> technical assistance and financial aid into agricultural extension services and farmer <br>subsidy programs.<br><br>
    
    Governments can also promote policies to prevent unfair trading practices (such as <br>last-minute order cancellations and unilateral or retroactive changes to contracts); <br>remove barriers to food redistribution via policies such as liability limitations and tax <br>breaks, which make it easier for food suppliers to donate safe but unsold food to <br>charities or those in need; and support policies to standardize food date labelling <br>practices to reduce confusion about product safety and quality and improve consumer<br> understanding of the meaning of date labels. Finally, governments can make <br>measurement and reporting of food loss and waste by large companies mandatory to <br>facilitate benchmarking, transparency and learning.</p><br><br>
