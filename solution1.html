    <div>Most people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce to parts of fruits and vegetables that could be eaten or repurposed.</div><br>
    <div><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=43836">One-third of all food</a> in the United States goes uneaten. EPA estimates that in 2019, about 96 percent of households' wasted food <br> ended up in landfills, combustion facilities, or down the drain to the sewer system. The remainder was composted.</div><br>
    <div>Preventing food from going to waste is one of the easiest and most powerful actions you can take to save money and lower your climate <br> change footprint by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving natural resources.</div><br>

   <ul>
    <li>Save money by buying only what you need, eating what you buy, and avoiding <br>throwing away food. . The average family of four spends $1,500 per year on food <br>that does not get eaten</li>
    <li>Reduce your environmental and climate change footprint.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Conserve resources and energy. When food is wasted, the land, water, <br>energy, and other inputs that are used in producing, processing, transporting, <br>preparing, storing, and disposing the food are wasted as well.</li>
        <li>Reduce GHG emissions. The majority of GHG emissions from landfilled food <br>waste result from activities prior to food entering a landfill, including the <br>production, transport, processing, and distribution of food. Plus, when food decomposes in a landfill, methane, a potent <br> greenhouse gas, is emitted. Municipal solid waste landfills are the third-largest source of human-related methane emissions in <br> the U.S. and food waste is responsible for 58% of landfill emissions.</li>

        <div class="p">Ways to Prevent Wasted Food at Home</div>
        <p>Planning, prepping, and storing food can help your household waste less food. Below <br>are some tips to help you do just that:</p>
        <div class="l">Planning and Shopping Tips</div>
        <p>Making a list with weekly meals in mind can save you money and time.  If you only <br> buy what you expect to use, you will be more likely to eat it all.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep a running list of meals and their ingredients that your household already <br> enjoys - that way, you can easily choose, shop for, and prepare meals that you are <br> likely to consume.</li><br>
            <li>Look in your refrigerator, freezer, and pantry first to avoid buying food you already <br> have. Make a list each week of what needs to be used up and plan upcoming <br>meals around it.</li><br>
            <li>Plan your meals for the week before you go shopping and buy only the things <br>needed for those meals.</li><br>
            <li>Make your shopping list based on how many meals you’ll eat at home. Consider <br> how often you will eat out, if you plan to eat frozen precooked meals, and if you <br>will eat leftovers for any of your meals.</li><br>
            <li>Include quantities on your shopping list noting how many meals you’ll make with <br>each item to avoid overbuying. For example: “salad greens - enough for two <br>lunches”.</li><br>
            <li>Buying in large quantities (e.g., buy one, get one free deals) only saves money if <br>you use all the food before it spoils.</li><br>
            <li>Buying food from bulk bins saves you money and <br>reduces food waste and packaging if you purchase <br> the amount of food you need. When buying in bulk,<br> remember to store food properly in airtight, labeled <br> containers.</li><br>
            <li>Purchase imperfect produce or upcycled products. <br> Imperfect produce may have physical imperfections  <br>but is just as safe and nutritious and can sometimes <br>be found at discounted prices. Upcycled products  <br>are made from ingredients that might have  <br>otherwise gone to waste.</li><br>

        </ul>
        <img id="f" src="planningshopping2_0.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="l" >Storage Tips
        </div><br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Properly store fruits and vegetables for maximum <br>freshness; they’ll taste better and last longer, helping you to eat more of them before they go bad.</li>
            <ul><li>Most veggies, especially those that could wilt (such as leafy greens, carrots, cucumbers, and broccoli) should go in the high <br>humidity drawer of the fridge.</li>
            <li>Most fruits, as well as vegetables that tend to rot (such as mushrooms and peppers), should go in the low humidity drawer of the <br> fridge.</li>
        <li>Some fruits (such as bananas, apples, pears, stone fruits, and avocados) release ethylene gas as they ripen, making other nearby <br>produce ripen, and potentially spoil, faster. Store these away from other produce.</li>
    <li>Wait to wash berries, cherries, and grapes until you’re ready to eat them to prevent mold.</li>
<li>Some produce, such as potatoes, eggplant, winter squash, onions, and garlic, should be stored in a cool, dry, dark, and well- <br>ventilated place.</li></ul><li>Make sure you are properly storing food in your refrigerator</li>
<ul><li>The refrigerator door is the warmest part of the fridge. You can store condiments there, but it is not recommended to store milk <br>or eggs in the door.</li>
<li>The lower shelves are the coldest part of the fridge. Store meat, poultry, and fish here.</li>
<li>Refrigerators should be set to maintain a temperature of 40 °F or below.</li></ul>
<li>Store grains in airtight containers and label containers with contents and the dates.</li>
    <li>Befriend your freezer and visit it often. Freeze food such as bread, sliced fruit, meat, or leftovers that you know won’t be eaten in time. <br> Label with the contents and dates.</li><br><br>

        </ul>
        <div class="l">Cooking and Preparation Tips</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Produce that is past its prime, as well as odds and <br>ends of ingredients and leftovers, may still be fine <br> for cooking. Repurpose these ingredients in soups,  <br>casseroles, stir fries, frittatas, sauces, baked goods, <br>pancakes, or smoothies. You’ll avoid wasting these <br>items and may even create new favorite dishes.</li><br>
            <li>If safe and healthy, use the edible parts of food <br>that you normally do not eat. For example, stale <br> bread can be used to make French Toast or <br>croutons, beet greens can be sautéed for a <br>delicious side dish, and vegetable scraps can be <br>used for soup stock.</li><br>
            <li>Learn the difference between “sell-by,” “use-by,” <br>“best-by,” and expiration dates.</li><br>
            <li>Aim to cook and serve the right portions for the number of people you are feeding.</li><br>
            <li>Freeze, pickle, dehydrate, can, or make jam/jelly from surplus fruits and vegetables - especially abundant seasonal produce.</li><br>
            <li>Don’t leave perishable food at room temperature for more than two hours.</li><br>
            <li>Refrigerate or freeze any leftovers in clear, labeled containers with dates.</li><br>

        </ul>

        <div class="p">Toolkits for Your Home and Your Community</div>
        <p>EPA developed two social marketing campaign toolkits for preventing food waste in your community and at home.  <br>"The Preventing Wasted Food in Your Community: A Social Marketing Toolkit" is a resource for states, territories, local governments, <br>Tribes, and nongovernmental organizations who want to start a behavior change campaign to prevent food waste in their communities. <br>It is designed to be used by governments and NGOs to help people reduce wasted food in the home. The toolkit includes a planning <br>process that uses social marketing principles to ensure communities are tailoring campaigns to their individual needs. <br> The toolkit walks you through the steps to design a behavior change campaign in your community. It moves beyond an <br>education/awareness campaign by identifying barriers people face in reducing their food waste and highlighting motivators that help <br>overcome those barriers. The toolkit offers an implementation and evaluation plan. It also includes wasted food prevention campaign <br>materials created by municipalities and organizations that are available for use and customization by any community. <br>The Food: Too Good to Waste Toolkit will help you figure out how much food is really going to waste in your home and what you can do <br> to waste less. By making small shifts in how you shop for, prepare, and store food, you can save time and money. It can also keep the <br>valuable resources used to produce and distribute food from going to waste! <br>Food: Too Good to Waste also contains an Implementation Guide that is designed to teach local governments and community <br>organizations how to implement a Food: Too Good to Waste campaign in their community using the Toolkit.</p>
        <div class="p">If You Can't Reduce Wasted Food, <br> Divert It From Landfills</div><br>
        <ul><li>Nutritious, safe, and untouched food can be donated to food banks to help those <br> in need.</li><br>
        <li>Compost food scraps rather than throwing them away. Learn more through this  <br>infographic on composting (pdf).</li><br></ul>

        <div class="l">Composting Food Scraps in Your Community: A Social <br> Marketing Toolkit</div>
        <p>If you are with a state, territorial, or local government, Tribe, or another organization <br> that wishes to create composting campaigns, check out our "Composting Food <br>Scraps in Your Community: A Social Marketing Toolkit." This toolkit is for communities that wants to:</p><br>
            <ol><li>launch new food scrap composting programs,</li><br>
                <li>increase participation in existing food scrap composting programs, or</li><br>
                <li>reduce contamination in their compost collection streams.</li><br>
            </ol>
            <p>It is designed to assist agencies that offer curbside collection or drop-off locations for residential food scraps. The toolkit includes a <br>planning process that uses social marketing principles to ensure campaigns are tailored to their community's needs.</p>
