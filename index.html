    <p id="b">Reducing food losses and waste is essential in a world where the number of people affected by hunger has been slowly on the <br>rise since 2014, and tons and tons of edible food are lost and/or wasted every. <br>

        Globally, around 13.2 percent of food produced is lost between harvest and retail, while an estimated 19 percent of total global <br>food production is wasted in households, in the food service and in retail all together.

       <a class="x" href="https://www.fao.org/platform-food-loss-waste/flw-events/international-day-food-loss-and-waste/en"> This International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste 2024</a> will highlight the critical need for financing to bolster <br>efforts to reduce food loss and waste, contribute to achieving climate goals and advancing the <a class="x" href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/">2030 Agenda for Sustainable <br>Development.</a>

            While an estimated 735 million people go hungry <br><br>globally, food loss and waste generate 8 to 10 <br><br>percent of GHGs and is a methane hotspot. <br>
            <hr>
            Households waste over 1 billion meals worth of <br><br>edible food every day, the equivalent of 1.3 <br><br>
             meals every day for everyone in the world <br><br> affected by hunger. <br>
             <hr>
             Opportunities to finance food loss and waste <br><br>reduction and low-carbon diets remain untapped,<br><br> with only USD 0.1 billion invested annually in <br><br>2019/20. This represents a minor fraction of <br><br>annual needs, estimated at USD 48 to 50 billion. <br><br>

        <section id="g"><b id="z">Why is it important to reduce food loss and waste?</b><br><br>
            <p class="h">Food loss and waste <b>undermine the sustainability of our food systems.</b> When food is lost or wasted, all the resources that <br>were used to produce this food - including water, land, energy, labour and capital - go to waste. In addition, the disposal of food <br>loss and waste in landfills, leads to greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. Food loss and waste can also <br>negatively impact food security and food availability, and contribute to increasing the cost of food.</p><br><br>
            <p class="h">Our food systems <b>cannot be resilient if they are not sustainable,</b> hence the need to focus on the adoption of integrated <br>approaches designed to reduce food loss and waste. Actions are required globally and locally to maximise the use of the food <br>we produce. The introduction of technologies, innovative solutions (including e-commerce platforms for marketing, retractable <br> mobile food processing systems), new ways of working and good practices to manage food quality and reduce food loss <br>and waste are key to implementing this transformative change.</p><br><br>
            <p class="h">With six years left to reach the target 12.3 of <a class="x" href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/">Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production), </a><br>there is an urgent need to accelerate action to reduce food loss and waste.</p>
